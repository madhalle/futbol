#### [Turing School](https://turing.io/) [Fútbol project](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/futbol/index)

## Overview

_Build a system to analyze fútbol team performance data._

## Learning Goals
- Build classes with single responsibilities
- Write organized readable code
- Use TDD as a design strategy
- Design an object oriented solution to a problem
- Practice algorithmic thinking
- Work in a group
- Use pull requests to collaborate among multiple partners

## Project Description
Using data from a fictional soccer league:
1. Analyze team performance for specific seasons and across seasons.
  - best and worst performers
  - specific statistics for individual teams
2. Create a *StatTracker* class that provides the necessary information.

The **first half** of the project focuses on building the base statistics functionality through *StatTracker*. The **second half** of the project incorporates reorganizing code to practice good SRP.

## Objectives

- Object Oriented Programming
- Single responsibilities for Classes
- Test Driven Development
- Writing organized and readable code
- Group collaboration
